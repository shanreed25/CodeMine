In the coming lessons, we'll be using the PyCharm Integrated Development Environment to learn to code. It's a completely free piece of software and is used by professional Python developers across the globe. They also have a handy course template feature, which we'll be using for the beginner parts of the lessons from Day 1 to 15. So while you might have another favourite code editor, I only recommend to use PyCharm for this course.

# 1. Download and install Python
- [complete the installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
**Make sure you tick the box to Add to PATH / Add to Environment Variables. You will also need tcl/tk later in the course, so a Custom install gives you access to all of these settings.**
# 2. Download the Free Community Edition of PyCharm using the link below:
