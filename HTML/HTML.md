# Core HTML Concepts 
**This categorization provides a foundational understanding of core HTML concepts, aiding in learning and implementing effective web development practices. Remember to always strive for semantic and accessible code, as it benefits both users and search engines**

## Basic Structure and Elements 
- HTML Document Structure: The basic structure of an HTML page, including <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body>
- Elements: The building blocks of a webpage, defined by tags (e.g., <p> for paragraphs, <h1> for headings).
- Tags: Hidden keywords that tell the browser how to display content.
- Attributes: Provide extra settings or information for elements (e.g., href for links, src for images).
- Heading Elements (h1-h6): Define the hierarchy of information on a page, ranging from highest (<h1>) to lowest (<h6>).
- Paragraph Element (): Used for creating blocks of text.
- Line Break Element (): Creates a line break in text without altering semantic structure.
- Image Element (): Embeds images using the src attribute for the image URL.
- Link Element (): Creates hyperlinks using the href attribute for the destination URL.
- Lists (, , ): Used for organizing items in bullet points (<ul>) or numbered order (<ol>) with list items denoted by <li>.
- Division Element (): A container for grouping other elements, often used for layout or styling.
- Span Element (): An inline container for text, primarily used for styling.
- Strong Element (): Highlights important text, often rendered in bold. 

## Forms and User Input
- Forms (): Used to collect user input.
- Input Element (): A versatile element for creating various input fields like text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc..
- Input Types: Different types define the purpose and behavior of the input field (e.g., "text", "password", "checkbox", "radio").
- Textarea (): Used for collecting longer text inputs.
- Select (): Creates a dropdown list of options.
- Button (): Creates a clickable button to trigger actions or submit forms.
- Labels (): Associate text labels with form elements, improving accessibility.

## Multimedia and Embedding
- Embedding Multimedia: HTML offers various tags to embed content like images, audio, video, and more.
- Image Tag (): Embeds images into a webpage, using src to specify the image source.
- Audio Tag (): Embeds audio files into a webpage.
- Video Tag (): Embeds video files into a webpage.
- Canvas Tag (): A blank area for drawing graphics and creating animations using JavaScript.
- Embed Tag (): Used to embed external content, including multimedia or web applications.
- Object Tag (): Embeds various types of external resources like images, videos, or PDFs. 

## Metadata and SEO
- Meta Tags: HTML elements providing information about a webpage for search engines and other clients (e.g., meta descriptions, meta robots).
- Title Tag (): Defines the title of the HTML document, appearing in the browser tab.
- Metadata: Data that describes and contextualizes other data, used by search engines to understand the content.
- Structured Data: Standardized formats for providing information about a webpage, improving its visibility in search results.
- Social Metadata: Information for social media platforms to display content previews.

## Accessibility and Best Practices
- Semantic HTML: Using HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning (e.g., <nav>, <article>, <aside>) to enhance accessibility.
- Alternative Text (alt text): Providing textual descriptions for images to aid visually impaired users and improve SEO.
- ARIA Attributes: Enhance accessibility for dynamic and interactive elements not fully described by standard HTML.
- Keyboard Accessibility: Ensuring all interactive elements can be accessed and operated using a keyboard.
- Form Accessibility: Using semantic markup and labels to create user-friendly forms.
- Descriptive Links: Using clear and descriptive text for hyperlinks, making their purpose obvious.
- Headings for Structure: Using heading tags (<h1> to <h6>) to organize content logically and hierarchically.
