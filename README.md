## HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
Purpose: Defines the structure and content of a web page.
Think of it as: The blueprint or skeleton of your website.
What it does: Organizes text, images, and other elements, instructing the browser on how to display them.
Example: Using tags like <header>, <footer>, and <article> to structure content.
Importance: It's the absolute foundation for any website and essential for front-end development.

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
Purpose: Controls the visual presentation and layout of web pages.
Think of it as: The style guide that dictates how your website looks, including colors, fonts, and layout.
What it does: Styles HTML elements, defining their appearance and how they are displayed.
Example: Applying styles to adjust font size, change colors, or position elements on the page.
Importance: Makes websites visually appealing and improves user experience.

## JavaScript (JS)
Purpose: Adds dynamic and interactive features to web pages.
Think of it as: The language that brings your website to life, allowing for interactive elements and user engagement.
What it does: Controls website behavior, enabling features like animations, interactive forms, and real-time updates.
Example: Creating a slideshow of images, playing audio/video, or changing button colors on hover.
Importance: Essential for modern web development, particularly for creating dynamic and user-friendly websites. 
In essence, HTML provides the structure, CSS handles the style, and JavaScript adds the interactivity.
