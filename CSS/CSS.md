# CSS

## Fundamentals
What CSS is: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and format web pages (described by HTML). It dictates how elements are displayed on screen, paper, or other media.
Syntax: CSS uses rule sets consisting of a selector (targets HTML elements) and a declaration block (styles applied to those elements).
Selectors: Patterns used to select HTML elements to style. Examples include element type, class, ID, attribute, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements.
Declarations: Property-value pairs within the declaration block that define how an element should be styled (e.g., color: blue;).
Properties: Style features that can be changed (e.g., color, size, font).
Values: The specific style to be applied to a property (e.g., red, 12px).
The Box Model: A fundamental concept describing how elements are sized and spaced. Every element is a rectangular box with properties like content, padding (space around content), border (line around padding), and margin (space outside the border).
The Cascade, Specificity, and Inheritance: CSS styles are applied in a "cascade" where multiple rules can apply to the same element.
The Cascade: Determines which styles take precedence when multiple rules conflict.
Specificity: Rules with higher specificity override those with lower specificity (e.g., ID selectors have higher specificity than class selectors).
Inheritance: Child elements can inherit properties from their parent elements. 
## Styling
Typography: Controlling text appearance (font family, size, weight, line-height, text decoration, etc.).
Colors: Specifying colors using various formats (RGB, hex codes, color names, transparency, gradients).
Backgrounds: Setting background colors, images, and repeating patterns.
Borders: Creating visible outlines around elements. 
## Layout
Display and Positioning: Controlling how elements are displayed and their position on the page. Includes concepts like block, inline, and flexbox models.
Flexbox: A one-dimensional layout model for arranging items in a container.
CSS Grid: A two-dimensional layout model for creating complex grid-based layouts with rows and columns.  
## Advanced Concepts
Responsive Design: Techniques for adapting layouts and styles to different screen sizes and devices using media queries.
Animations and Transitions: Creating smooth animations and transitions between element states.
Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements: Styling elements based on their state (e.g., :hover) or specific parts of an element (e.g., ::first-line).
Z-index: Controlling the stacking order of elements.
User Interface: Properties specifically designed to enhance the user interface (e.g., resizing elements).
Blend Modes: Creating visual effects by blending the background and foreground colors of elements. 
## Best Practices & Organization
External Stylesheets: Storing CSS code in separate .css files for better organization and reusability.
Selector Lists: Grouping selectors with the same style definitions to minimize code.
Code Organization: Writing clean and efficient code, avoiding duplication.  
By understanding these categories, you can build a solid foundation for learning and mastering CSS. Remember to practice and explore documentation like the MDN Web Docs to deepen your knowledge.
