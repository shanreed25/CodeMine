                <h2>Events</h2>
                <p>Events are actions or occurrences that happen
                    in the browser. They are triggered by user interactions or by the
                    browser itself.
                </p>
                <p>The system tells you about these events
                    and you can create JavaScript code that will react to them
                </p>
                <h4>Types of Events</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Mouse Events:</span> Triggered by mouse interactions, such as click, onclick,
                        mousedown, mouseup, mousemove, mouseenter, and mouseleave.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Keyboard Events:</span> Triggered by keyboard interactions, such as keydown,
                        keyup, and keypress.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Form Events:</span> Triggered by form interactions, such as input, change,
                        submit, focus, and blur.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Window Events:</span> Triggered by window actions, such as load, resize,
                        scroll, and beforeunload.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Document Events:</span> Triggered by document changes, such as
                        DOMContentLoaded and visibilitychange.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Clipboard Events:</span> Triggered by clipboard actions, such as copy, paste,
                        and cut.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Drag and Drop Events:</span> Triggered by drag and drop actions.</li>

                    <li><span class="bold">Focus and Blur Events:</span> Triggered when an element gains or loses focus

                <h2>Event Handling Methods</h2>
                <p>Event handlers allow developers to define how a web page should respond to events.</p>
                <p>When an event occurs on a target element, a handler function is executed in response to that event.
                </p>

                <h4>How to use event handler functions with events</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="bold">Element Selection:</span> Select the HTML element to which you want to attach
                        an event handler.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Event Type:</span> Specify the type of event you want to listen for.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Event Handler Function:</span> Define a JavaScript function that will be
                        executed when the specified event occurs on the selected element</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Event Binding:</span> Bind the event handler function to the selected element
                        and event type</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>There are three main ways to bind/add event handlers to HTML elements:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Inline Event Handlers:</span>Defined directly in HTML attributes</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Event Listener Method:</span>Uses builted in Javascript methods to attach and
                        detach event handlers. </li>

                        JavaScript</li>

                <p>Inline event handlers are defined directly in the HTML element's opening tag of the target element
                </p>
                <p>The event handler function is added as the value to an event handler attribute that start with "on".

                    <li>Add a event attribute to the element</li>
                    <li>As the value of the event attribute, include the JavaScript code you want to execute when the
                        event occurs</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This code can be a single statement, or you can call a JavaScript function</li>

            <h4>Drawbacks of Inline Event Handlers </h4>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Mixing concerns:</span> They mix HTML and JavaScript, making code harder to maintain and understand</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Limited flexibility:</span> Only one handler can be attached per event per element, and they cannot be dynamically added or removed</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Potential security risks:</span> Inline scripts can increase vulnerability to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Global scope issues:</span> Functions called from inline handlers must be globally accessible, which can lead to namespace conflicts</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Accessibility issues:</span> Certain device-dependent inline handlers like onmouseover can cause accessibility problems. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Inline event handlers should be used for simple basic uses but are not recommended for complex applications due to these drawbacks</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The standard and recommended way to handle events</li>
                        <li>Allows attaching multiple event listeners to an element without overwriting existing ones</li>
                        <li>Offers more control over event propagation (bubbling/capturing)</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Frameworks like React and Vue.js:</span> Only one handler can be attached per event per element, and they cannot be dynamically added or removed</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Component-based approaches manage event handling in a more structured and maintainable way. </li>

            <div>
                <h2>Event Listener Method</h2>
                <p>The addEventListener() method takes the event name and the function to be executed as arguments. This method is recommended for its power and scalability, allowing multiple handlers, providing more control over event propagation, and being easier to remove with removeEventListener(). </p>
                <p>When an event occurs on a target element, a handler function is executed in response to that event.
